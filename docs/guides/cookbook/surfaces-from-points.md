# Surfaces from Points

Given a set of 3D points, OCCTSwift can fit a smooth B-spline `Surface` through them. There are two
cases, and they take different functions:

- **A regular grid** of samples (rows × columns, a height field, a scan) → `Surface.fromPointGrid`
  (`GeomAPI_PointsToBSplineSurface`).
- **A scattered cloud** with no grid structure → `Surface.plateThrough` (`GeomPlate`).

Both return a `Surface`; call `.toFace()` to get a renderable / sewable `Shape`.

## A grid of samples → `fromPointGrid`

When the points form a topological grid, pass them **row-major** (`point[v*uCount + u]`) with the row
and column counts. The result approximates the points within `tolerance`:

```swift
var pts = [SIMD3<Double>]()
let n = 6
for v in 0..<n {
    for u in 0..<n {
        let x = Double(u) * 4, y = Double(v) * 4
        pts.append(SIMD3(x, y, 3 * sin(x * 0.3) * cos(y * 0.3)))   // a wavy height field
    }
}

guard let surface = Surface.fromPointGrid(points: pts, uCount: n, vCount: n,
                                          degMin: 3, degMax: 8,
                                          continuity: 2, tolerance: 1e-3) else { return }
let face = surface.toFace()
```

It **approximates** (not strictly interpolates): tighten `tolerance` to pull the surface closer to the
samples, raise `degMax` for more flexibility. `points.count` must equal `uCount * vCount`.

## A scattered cloud → `plateThrough`

When the points have no grid order, the **plate** surface (`GeomPlate_BuildPlateSurface`) builds a
smooth, energy-minimizing B-spline through them, minimum 3 points:

```swift
let points: [SIMD3<Double>] = [
    SIMD3(0, 0, 0), SIMD3(10, 0, 1), SIMD3(10, 10, 2),
    SIMD3(0, 10, 1), SIMD3(5, 5, 3),     // a high point in the middle
]
guard let plate = Surface.plateThrough(points, degree: 3, tolerance: 0.01) else { return }
```

`plateThrough` doesn't need any ordering or counts, it's the right tool for an irregular set of
constraint points (probe data, feature points). The trade-off is less direct control over the
parametrization than the grid fit gives you.

Like the grid fit, it **approximates**, so check the result against `tolerance` rather than
assuming it, especially on a cloud with real curvature in it:

```swift
let worst = points.compactMap { plate.projectPoint($0)?.distance }.max() ?? 0
if worst > 0.01 { /* the plate could not be fitted this tightly */ }
```

Before #571 that check could never pass on a demanding cloud: the fit was capped at a single Bezier
patch, which is the one setting that stops the approximator acting on its own error estimate, so a
`tolerance: 0.01` request could return a surface `0.072` away and report success. If
`plate.uPoleCount` is at most `degree + 1`, the fit never subdivided.

## Deform an existing surface to hit target points

If you already have a surface and want to **pull it through** specific positions, the non-linear plate
solver deforms it to meet `(u, v) → target` constraints:

```swift
let plane = Surface.plane(origin: .zero, normal: SIMD3(0, 0, 1))!
let bumped = plane.nlPlateDeformed(
    constraints: [(uv: SIMD2(0, 0), target: SIMD3(0, 0, 5))],   // lift the centre to z = 5
    maxIterations: 4, tolerance: 1e-3)
```

This keeps the surface's existing shape and only displaces it to satisfy the constraints, distinct
from fitting a fresh surface to a point set. (A `G0+G1` variant also takes tangent constraints.)

## Which to use

| You have | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Points on a regular **grid** (rows × cols) | `Surface.fromPointGrid` |
| A **scattered** point cloud | `Surface.plateThrough` |
| An existing surface to **pull through** target points | `surface.nlPlateDeformed` |
| A wireframe of **curves** (profiles × guides) | [`Surface.gordon`](gordon-surfaces.md) |
