# Carried OCCT source patches

Patches in this directory are upstream-bound OCCT bug fixes we carry until they ship in an OCCT
release. `Scripts/build-occt.sh` applies each one (idempotently, `-p1`, `a/`,`b/` prefixes) to
`Libraries/occt-src` before every cmake build. A patch takes effect only when the xcframework is
**rebuilt** from source — the binary shipped in `Libraries/OCCT.xcframework` does not yet include it
until a rebuild + release.

## 0001-ShapeFix_Face-guard-non-face-context-replacement-263.patch

**Fixes the upstream OCCT crash behind [#263](https://github.com/SecondMouseAU/OCCTSwift/issues/263)**
(reported upstream as [Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT#1322](https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT/issues/1322)).

`ShapeFix_Face::Perform` casts `Context()->Apply(myFace)` with `TopoDS::Face(S.EmptyCopied())` in
three places, none of which check the type. When an earlier fix sharing the same `ShapeBuild_ReShape`
context has replaced the face with a **compound** (e.g. a self-intersecting face split into several
faces), `Apply()` returns a non-face. The unchecked cast then builds an invalid `TopoDS_Face` handle
over a compound `TShape`; subsequent topology operations corrupt the heap and abort the process with
an uncatchable OS signal (`ShapeFix_Face::FixOrientation` → `BRep_Tool::Curve` → `BRep_TEdge::EmptyCopy`,
SIGSEGV/SIGBUS at varying addresses).

The compound replacement already exists on entry to `Perform` (it was recorded by a prior face's
fix), so the patch adds a single guard at the top of `Perform`: if `Context()->Apply(myFace)` is not
a face, record it as the result and return — the replacement is already in the context, so there is
nothing to fix here. This one guard covers all three cast sites.

**Validation** (fast path, no full rebuild): compile the single patched TU and link it *before*
`libOCCT-macos.a` so it overrides that symbol:

```bash
clang++ -std=c++17 -O2 -w -I Libraries/OCCT.xcframework/macos-arm64/Headers \
  -c Libraries/occt-src/src/ModelingAlgorithms/TKShHealing/ShapeFix/ShapeFix_Face.cxx -o /tmp/sff.o
clang++ -std=c++17 -O2 repro.cxx /tmp/sff.o \
  -L Libraries/OCCT.xcframework/macos-arm64 -lOCCT-macos -framework Foundation -framework AppKit -lz -lc++ -o repro
MMGT_OPT=0 ./repro
```

A 4-point "bowtie" face extruded into a prism and healed (`ShapeFix_Shape`) crashes 3/3 on stock
OCCT 8.0.0p1 and survives 5/5 with the patch; the four `OCCTReconstruct` `crash-repro` fixtures
likewise survive. `ShapeFix_Shape` output on valid box/sphere/cylinder is byte-identical to stock
(the guard only triggers for a non-face replacement, which never happens for a well-formed face).

Until the xcframework is rebuilt with this patch, the in-wrapper guard shipped in v1.8.3
(`occtHasSelfIntersectingWire`) prevents the crash from reaching this code.
