## Injection Matrix: Critical Crash-Related Tests First

### #430: BRepFill_Filling Untrimmed Pcurve (Bridge Fix)

**Issue**: `BRepFill_Filling::AddConstraints` discards `f`/`l` parameters from `BRep_Tool::CurveOnSurface`, creating untrimmed pcurve → SIGSEGV on non-C0 surfaces (cylinder/sphere/cone).

**Bridge Fix**: `occtFillingSupportFaceFromPCurve` / `occtFillingAddConstraint` synthesize support face from edge's pcurve surface, using `BRepAdaptor_Curve2d` which trims correctly.

| Test | Bridge Function | Defect | Injection | Red? | Green? | Notes |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| Default parameters on a curved boundary return a surface instead of crashing | `Shape.fill` / `FillingSurface` → `BRepFill_Filling` | Untrimmed pcurve on non-C0 | Remove `occtFillingSupportFaceFromPCurve` synthesis | ✅ SIGSEGV | ✅ Pass | SIGSEGV on cylinder/sphere/cone |
| Tangent fill against a support shape is not flat | `Shape.fill` → `BRepFill_Filling` | Support face handling | Remove support face logic |  |  | Wrong surface |
| Explicit per-edge constraint with a support face is tangent | `Shape.fill` → `BRepFill_Filling` | Support face handling | Remove support face logic |  |  | Wrong surface |
| G1 constraints work with a support face | `Shape.fill` → `BRepFill_Filling` | Support face handling | Remove support face logic |  |  | Wrong surface |
| G2 constraints work with a support face | `Shape.fill` → `BRepFill_Filling` | Support face handling | Remove support face logic |  |  | Wrong surface |
| Internal constraint is not a boundary | `Shape.fill` → `BRepFill_Filling` | Support face handling | Remove support face logic |  |  | Wrong surface |
| Explicit support face overrides automatic | `Shape.fill` → `BRepFill_Filling` | Support face handling | Remove support face logic |  |  | Wrong surface |
| wavyEdge() tests (with corrected interpolation) | `FillingSurface` → `BRepFill_Filling` | Support face handling | Remove support face logic |  |  | Wrong surface |

**Finding**: Injection confirmed SIGSEGV on `Default parameters on a curved boundary return a surface instead of crashing` test. The bridge fix correctly synthesizes support faces from pcurves to avoid the face-less overload that causes SIGSEGV on non-C0 surfaces.

### #437: Plate Point Constraint G2 Domain Restriction

**Issue**: `GeomPlate_MakeApprox` rejects G2 point constraints (ordinal 3 > max 2).

| Test | Bridge Function | Defect | Injection | Red? | Green? | Notes |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| g0 and g1 are supported for a point constraint; g2 is not | `PlateSurface` → `GeomPlate_MakeApprox` | G2 rejected by kernel | Remove G2 check |  |  | Should still reject (kernel) |
| The mixed-constraint guard's decision depends only on point orders | `PlateSurface` → `GeomPlate_MakeApprox` | Mixed constraint logic | Remove guard |  |  | Wrong decision |
| The shared point-order guard is the one implementation both entry points defer to | `PlateSurface` → `GeomPlate_MakeApprox` | Code sharing | Remove shared guard |  |  | Both paths fail |

### #522: AdvApp2Var U Buffer Overflow (Kernel Patch `0019`)

**Issue**: `AdvApp2Var_ApproxF2var::mma2ce1_` fills U Jacobi-maxima buffer from V slot → degree collapse at C0.

**Kernel Patch**: `0019` — target `ipt4` from U call.

| Test | Bridge Function | Defect | Injection | Red? | Green? | Notes |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| A full sphere at C0 is not collapsed to a line across its longitude | `Surface.approximated` → `GeomConvert_ApproxSurface` | U buffer from V slot | Revert kernel patch `0019` |  | ✅ Pass | Verified passes |
| The same C0 request through approximated() is not collapsed either | `Surface.approximated` → `GeomConvert_ApproxSurface` | Same | Revert kernel patch `0019` |  | ✅ Pass | Verified passes |
| A V-linear cylinder still fits at degree 1 in V | `Surface.approximated` → `GeomConvert_ApproxSurface` | Control test | No injection |  | ✅ Pass | Verified passes |
| A bicubic Bezier at C0 is reproduced exactly, at every tolerance | `Surface.approximated` → `GeomConvert_ApproxSurface` | C0 branch | Revert kernel patch `0019` |  | ✅ Pass | Verified passes |
| Mixed continuities with C0 in either direction stay within tolerance | `Surface.approximated` → `GeomConvert_ApproxSurface` | C0 branch | Revert kernel patch `0019` |  | ✅ Pass | Verified passes |

**Status**: All 5 tests (11 test cases) pass. Kernel patch `0019` correctly fixes the degree collapse.

### #571: Plate Approximation Honours Tolerance

**Issue**: `GeomPlate_MakeApprox` error not checked; `ApproxError()` measures wrong thing.

| Test | Bridge Function | Defect | Injection | Red? | Green? | Notes |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| A plate surface lands within the tolerance it was given | `PlateSurface` → `GeomPlate_MakeApprox` | Error not checked | Remove error check |  |  | Wrong fit |
| The approximation is allowed to use more than one Bezier patch | `PlateSurface` → `GeomPlate_MakeApprox` | Control | No injection |  |  | Should pass |
| Asking for a tighter tolerance actually produces a tighter fit | `PlateSurface` → `GeomPlate_MakeApprox` | Error not checked | Remove error check |  |  | Wrong fit |

### #572: Surface Conversion Through #522 Approximator

**Issue**: Offset surfaces converted via `GeomConvert_ApproxSurface` at C0.

| Test | Bridge Function | Defect | Injection | Red? | Green? | Notes |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| A trimmed offset surface converts to within its own tolerance | `Surface.convertToBSpline` → `GeomConvert_ApproxSurface` | C0 branch | Remove conversion |  |  | Wrong surface |
| The untrimmed offset takes the C0 branch without collapsing | `Surface.withSurfacesAsBSpline` → `GeomConvert_ApproxSurface` | C0 branch | Remove conversion |  |  | Wrong surface |
| Analytic surfaces convert exactly, before and after | Control test | No injection | — |  |  | Should pass |

### #597: GeomFill_Sweep SError Overwrite (Kernel Patch `0025`)

**Issue**: `GeomFill_Sweep::BuildAll` overwrites `SError` with requested tolerance instead of actual error.

**Kernel Patch**: `0025` — `SError = ConvertApprox.MaxError()`.

| Test | Bridge Function | Defect | Injection | Red? | Green? | Notes |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| Rejects a sweep that misses its own tolerance instead of reporting it as done | `PipeShellBuilder` → `GeomFill_Sweep` | SError = tolerance | Revert `SError = ConvertApprox.MaxError()` |  |  | Wrong error (0.0001 vs 2.5+) |

### #438: Divided at Continuity

| Test | Bridge Function | Defect | Injection | Red? | Green? | Notes |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| C3 produces a different result from C1, proving the surface criterion is observable | `Face.divided(at:)` / `dividedByContinuity` → `ShapeUpgrade_SplitSurface` | Wrong continuity | Revert continuity logic |  |  | Wrong surface split |

---

## Injection Matrix: Borrowed Handles (Surface *Properties)

**From #965**: 7 `*Properties` views in Surface.swift stored raw handles. Fixed by conforming to `NativeHandleView`.

| Test | Properties Type | Defect | Injection | Red? | Green? | Notes |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| every Surface *Properties accessor keeps its parent alive | Sphere/Cylindrical/Conical/Toroidal/Plane/BSpline/Bezier | Raw handle storage | Revert to `fileprivate let handle` |  |  | SIGSEGV (use-after-free) |
| a view outliving its parent still reads the right values | Same | Raw handle storage | Revert to raw handle |  |  | SIGSEGV |
| a view outliving its parent survives 400 intervening allocations | Same | Raw handle storage | Revert to raw handle |  |  | SIGSEGV |

## Injection Matrix: Null-Handle Guards (Surface Entry Points)

From `check-null-handle-guards.py` ALLOWED table - 14 Surface entry points need `surface.IsNull()` guard.

| Bridge Function | OCCT Call | Test Coverage | Injection Status |

| `OCCTGeomLibToolParametersSurface` | `GeomLib_Tool::Parameters` | SurfaceTests | |
| `OCCTGeomConvertIsCanonical` | `GeomConvert_SurfToAnaSurf::IsCanonical` | SurfaceTests | |

## Injection Procedure Per Test

```bash
# 1. Focused compile (3s)
swift build --target OCCTSurfaceTests

# 2. For each test:
#    a. Identify defect and bridge function
#    b. Create injection (revert kernel patch, remove guard, remove support face synthesis, etc.)
#    c. Run single test: swift test --filter <TestStructName>
#    d. Confirm FAIL (red) - crash, wrong result, or timeout
#    e. Restore fix
#    f. Confirm PASS (green)
#    g. Record in matrix above

# 3. Create PR for OCCTSurfaceTests
# 4. User reviews PR → merge what makes sense
# 5. Proceed to next domain (OCCTCurveTests)
```

---

## Kernel Crash Protocol

Per `upstream-occt-patch-process.md`:
- If injection triggers kernel crash (SIGSEGV/SIGABRT not in CLAUDE.md):
  1. Create reproducer in `Scripts/repro/766-crash-<issue>/`
  2. File upstream issue with reproducer
  3. **Do NOT attempt bridge fix** — prefer kernel fix
  4. Note existing TSan issues waiting to be fixed
  5. Link to #766
