# Phase 3: OCCTBRepGraphTests Injection Matrix

**Target**: `OCCTBRepGraphTests` (18 tests) — BRepGraph traversal, attributes, queries
**Policy**: `prove-the-test-fails.md` — inject defect → confirm fail (red) → restore → confirm pass (green)
**Priority**: 🟡 P2 (graph traversal, thread safety)

## Bridge-Kernel Parity Checks

For each test, run ground-truth C++ comparison:
1. Write C++ test calling OCCT kernel directly
2. Run same inputs through Swift bridge
3. Compare outputs bit-for-bit (integers) or 1e-12 relative (doubles)
4. Document any discrepancies
