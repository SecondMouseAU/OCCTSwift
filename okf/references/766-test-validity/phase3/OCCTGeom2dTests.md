# Phase 3: OCCTGeom2dTests Injection Matrix

**Target**: `OCCTGeom2dTests` (545 tests) — 2D geometry, curves, adaptors
**Policy**: `prove-the-test-fails.md` — inject defect → confirm fail (red) → restore → confirm pass (green)
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (crash fixes #345, #603, #636, #477 in 2D)

## Injection Matrix: Critical Crash-Related Tests First

### #345: gp_Dir2d Zero Vector Crash (Bridge Fix)

**Issue**: `gp_Dir2d` constructor throws `Standard_ConstructionError` for zero-length direction vector.

**Bridge Fix**: Wrapped constructors in `try { } catch (...) { <safe fallback> }`.

| Test | Bridge Function | Defect | Injection | Red? | Green? | Notes |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| mirrorAxisZeroDirection (2D) | `OCCTMakeMirror2dAxis` → `gp_Dir2d` | Zero direction vector | Remove `try/catch` |  |  | SIGABRT |
| geomDirection2dZeroVector | `OCCTGeomDirection2dCreate` → `Geom2d_Direction` | Zero vector handled | N/A | N/A |  | Graceful |

### #603: CPnts_AbscissaPoint 2D Single Quadrature (Bridge + Kernel Fix)

**Issue**: `CPnts_AbscissaPoint::Length` on 2D curves uses single quadrature → arc length errors.

**Bridge Fix**: Adaptive quadrature in `occtAdaptorArcLength` (2D version).

**Kernel Patch**: `0021` — applies to 2D as well.

| Test | Bridge Function | Defect | Injection | Red? | Green? | Notes |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| A whole ellipse measures its own circumference (2D) | `Curve2D.arcLength` → `occtAdaptorArcLength` | Single quadrature | Remove adaptive quadrature |  |  | Error up to 1.7% |
| A parabola over a wide range measures its arc (2D) | `Curve2D.arcLength` → `occtAdaptorArcLength` | Single quadrature | Remove adaptive quadrature |  |  | Error 3% |
| The closed forms stay exact (2D) | `Curve2D.arcLength` → closed-form | Control | No injection |  |  | Line/circle |
| Accurate sub-ranges sum to whole (2D) | `Curve2D.arcLength(from:to:)` | Single quadrature | Remove adaptive quadrature |  |  | Error accumulates |
| parameterAtLength walks correctly (2D) | `Curve2D.parameterAtLength` | Single quadrature | Remove adaptive quadrature |  |  | Inverse wrong |

### #636: Curve2D extrema on Parallel Curves (Bridge Fix)

| Test | Bridge Function | Defect | Injection | Red? | Green? | Notes |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| Two unbounded parallel lines: extrema is empty (2D) | `Curve2D.extrema(to:)` → `Geom2dAPI_ExtremaCurveCurve` | Parallel crash | Remove `isParallel` guard |  |  | SIGSEGV |
| Two bounded parallel segments: extrema is empty (2D) | `Curve2D.extrema(to:)` → `Geom2dAPI_ExtremaCurveCurve` | Parallel crash | Remove `isParallel` guard |  |  | SIGSEGV |

### #477: Arc-Length Per-Span Split (2D) (Bridge Fix)

| Test | Bridge Function | Defect | Injection | Red? | Green? | Notes |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| length of a multi-span interpolated BSpline matches reference (2D) | `Curve2D.arcLength` → `occtAdaptorArcLength` | No per-span adaptive | Remove adaptive quadrature |  |  | Error > 1e-9 |
| length(from:to:) over a sub-range matches reference (2D) | `Curve2D.arcLength(from:to:)` | No per-span adaptive | Remove adaptive quadrature |  |  | Error > 1e-9 |

## Injection Matrix: Borrowed Handles (Curve2D *Properties)

**From #965**: 7 `*Properties` views in Curve2D.swift stored raw handles. Fixed by conforming to `NativeHandleView`.

| Test | Properties Type | Defect | Injection | Red? | Green? | Notes |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| every Curve2D *Properties accessor keeps its parent alive | Circle/Ellipse/Hyperbola/Parabola/Line/BSpline/Bezier | Raw handle storage | Revert to `fileprivate let handle` |  |  | SIGSEGV (use-after-free) |
| a view outliving its parent still reads the right values | Same | Raw handle storage | Revert to raw handle |  |  | SIGSEGV |
| a view outliving its parent survives 400 intervening allocations | Same | Raw handle storage | Revert to raw handle |  |  | SIGSEGV |

## Injection Matrix: Null-Handle Guards (Curve2D Entry Points)

From `check-null-handle-guards.py` ALLOWED table - 8 Curve2D entry points need `curve.IsNull()` guard.

| Bridge Function | OCCT Call | Test Coverage | Injection Status |
|-----------------|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| `OCCTGeomLibToolParameter2D` | `GeomLib_Tool::Parameter` | Geom2dTests | |
| `OCCTExtremaLocateExtCC2d` | `Geom2dAdaptor_Curve` | Geom2dTests | |
| `OCCTGeom2dConvertApproxArcsSegments` | `Geom2dAdaptor_Curve` | Geom2dTests | |
| `OCCTGeom2dConvertApproxArcsSegments` (local handle) | `BRep_Tool::CurveOnSurface` | StressTests | |

### #1979 executed: `Curve2DApproximatedOverloadParityTests.swift`, `Curve2DArcLengthFailureTests.swift`, `Curve2DArcTypesTests.swift`

Probe: `Scripts/repro/766-geom2d-approx-arclength-arctypes/`. Every row was run red with the injection applied and green after it was reverted.

| Curve2D Approximated Overload Parity Tests::Whole-domain overload's implicit default tolerance produces a real, non-trivial fit error | `OCCTCurve2DApproximate` | tolerance x 10 | ✅ | ✅ | MATCH |  |
| Curve2D Approximated Overload Parity Tests::Ranged overload's implicit default tolerance produces a near-exact fit | `OCCTApproxCurve2d` | approximate only half the range | ✅ | ✅ | MATCH |  |
| Curve2D Approximated Overload Parity Tests::Both overloads independently succeed on the same curve; neither promises to structurally match the other | `OCCTCurve2DApproximate / OCCTApproxCurve2d` | whole-domain tolerance x 10 | ✅ | ✅ | MATCH | `degree != nil` on both; now pins degree 8 / 27 poles on both |
| Curve2D Approximated Overload Parity Tests::Whole-domain overload's continuity is a live knob; ranged overload has none | `OCCTCurve2DApproximate` | ignore continuity (always C2) | ✅ | ✅ | MATCH | two `!= nil` checks could not show the knob is live; now pins 15 poles at C0 and 13 at C2 |
| Curve2D.arcLength(from:to:) distinguishes failure from zero (#409)::A genuine failure is reported as -1.0, not 0.0 | `OCCTCurve2DGetLengthBetween` | skip the parameter-range validation | ✅ | ✅ | MATCH |  |
| Curve2D.arcLength(from:to:) distinguishes failure from zero (#409)::Equal bounds are a genuine zero-length result, not the failure sentinel | `OCCTCurve2DGetLengthBetween` | report a zero-width interval as failure (-1) | ✅ | ✅ | MATCH |  |
| Curve2D.arcLength(from:to:) distinguishes failure from zero (#409)::Both spellings tolerate a reversed range and agree on it | `OCCTCurve2DGetLengthBetween` | scale every length by 1.01 | ✅ | ✅ | MATCH | agreement between the spellings passed a length both got wrong; now pins 6.34269563057 |
