// without OCC_CONVERT_SIGNALS in this build). So the prism/heal wrappers must DETECT and
// refuse the input (return nil) rather than build/heal the crashing solid. Cheap: a pure
// BRepCheck topology pass, no meshing. Definition lives in OCCTBridge.mm. See issue #263.

// === #446: ShapeUpgrade_UnifySameDomain consumes the shape it is given ===
//
// The algorithm rewrites sub-shapes of its INPUT, and those rewrites reach the TShapes the
// caller's shape still shares — so a caller who discards the result still ends up with a
// different (measurably worse: reported self-intersecting, and here provably larger in BREP)
// shape than the one they handed in. `SetSafeInputMode` does not cover it: even in safe mode,
// TransformPCurves (ShapeUpgrade_UnifySameDomain.cxx) writes temporary pcurves onto the input's
// edges against a scratch reference face, and only ever removes them again when that face is
// later replaced. OCCT documents the class as producing a new shape and says nothing about the
// input being consumed.
//
// Every entry point in this bridge therefore unifies a private COPY: the three below, plus the
// OCCTUnifySameDomain builder (OCCTBridge_Modeling.mm), which keeps its copier alive so
// KeepShape can map the caller's sub-shapes onto their counterparts in the copy.

// === #442/#443: multi-body shell selection ===
//
// Definitions live in OCCTBridge_Healing.mm, next to the ShapeFix_Solid entry points they
// were written for (#442). Shared because the same "which shells bound a body" question is
// asked by every call that turns shells into solids: the solid-from-shell entry points in
// OCCTBridge_Modeling.mm ask it too, and each having its own answer is what #443 records.

// The shells that bound a body, in exploration order: within each solid, every shell an even
// number of the others enclose, plus every shell belonging to no solid at all. A solid's
// cavity shells are left out, because a hole is not a body and turning one into a positive solid
// would give a compound whose volume double-counts the part. Returns empty when `shape`
// holds no shell, which callers take as "nothing to build".

// === #430/#432: surface-filling constraint helpers ===

// BRepOffsetAPI_MakeFilling) and OCCTFilling* (OCCTBridge_Modeling.mm, on BRepFill_Filling).
// Definitions live in OCCTBridge_Healing.mm. Converging the two wrappers themselves is #434.

// Map a plate constraint order (0=position, 1=tangency, 2=curvature) onto the GeomAbs_Shape
// value BRepFill_Filling actually accepts. It forwards the enum straight through to
// GeomPlate_CurveConstraint/BRepFill_CurveConstraint as an integer order, and both reject
// anything outside [-1, 2]. So curvature is GeomAbs_C1 (ordinal 2); GeomAbs_G2 (ordinal 3) and
// GeomAbs_C2 (ordinal 4) always throw, whatever BRepOffsetAPI_MakeFilling.hxx claims.

// Build a support face carrying the edge's own pcurve, for edges with no nominated support face.
//
// This exists to keep BRepFill_Filling's face-less Add(edge, order) overload out of the call
// path for continuity above C0. That overload builds its constraint from the UNTRIMMED pcurve
// (it fetches the edge's [f, l] range and then discards it), which for the usual Geom2d_Line
// pcurve means a +/-2e100 parameter range instead of the edge's own. What happens next depends
// on the support surface: a bounded one throws a catchable Standard_Failure ("U parameters out
// of range"), but an unbounded or periodic one accepts the garbage, the constraint cannot be
// projected, and GeomPlate_BuildPlateSurface::Perform's recovery path then dereferences its own
// still-null myGeomPlateSurface — an uncatchable SIGSEGV, not an exception. That planar/curved
// split is why the defect stayed hidden. Routing through Add(edge, face, order) instead uses
// BRepAdaptor_Curve2d, which trims correctly, and yields results identical to a real support
// face. Upstream defect; see issue #430 and Scripts/repro/430-fill-untrimmed-pcurve/.
